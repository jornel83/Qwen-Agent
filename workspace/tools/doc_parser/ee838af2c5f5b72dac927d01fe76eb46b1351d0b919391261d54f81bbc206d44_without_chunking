Describes the desired content of the generated image.\n- `negative_prompt`: Optional. Describes content to avoid; defaults to an empty string.\n- `width`: Required. The width of the generated image in pixels. Must be set to 1920.\n- `height`: Required. Height of the generated image in pixels.Must be set to 1080.\n- `steps`: Optional. Number of diffusion steps, default is 30.\n- `guidance_scale`: Optional. Controls the consistency between the image and the text description, default is 3.5.\n- `seed`: Optional. Random seed, -1 means random.\n\nThe large model should reasonably infer these parameter values based on user needs before calling this tool.\n\n## Flux Dev: Open-Weight Text-to-Image Model\n\nThe Flux Text-to-Image Tool is a text-to-image tool built on top of Flux Dev Model.\n\n### Overview\nFlux Dev (formally **FLUX 1 dev**) is a 12-billion-parameter text-to-image model released by **Black Forest Labs**.  \nIt offers near-flagship image quality, ships with full FP16 weights (~23 GB), and\nis distributed under a research-friendly non-commercial licence that still\nallows fine-tuning and private deployment.\n\n### Key Features\n\n#### High-Resolution Single-Prompt Generation\n* Generates images up to **1024 × 1024 px** natively, with community workflows\n  reaching 2 K while retaining texture and composition fidelity.\n* Delivers strong prompt adherence across diverse scenes and styles.\n\n#### Ready-to-Run Inference Options\n| Environment          | How to use                                               |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Python / Diffusers** | `FluxPipeline` loads weights in a few lines of code.   |\n| **ComfyUI**          | Node workflow + FP8 / FP16 checkpoints for low-VRAM rigs |\n| **Hosted APIs**      | Instant REST / streaming endpoints on Fal.ai & Replicate |\n\n#### Lightweight Fine-Tuning & Extensions\nFully compatible with **LoRA** and adapter training, so you can inject new\nstyles, characters, or product imagery without retraining the full network.\n\n### Licence & Usage\n* **Flux Dev Non-Commercial Licence** – free for personal, academic and other\n  non-profit projects.  \n* Any commercial use of the model or derivative checkpoints requires a paid,\n  separate agreement with Black Forest Labs.\n\n### Typical Use Cases\n1. **Concept design & prototyping** – offline generation keeps unreleased IP secure.  \n2. **Educational / media demos** – create illustrative visuals for talks, courses or blogs.  \n3. **Custom LoRA creation** – build brand-specific or stylistic add-ons atop the open weights.  \n\n### Tip\nFlux Dev generally performs well without negative prompts; if VRAM is limited, load the FP8 checkpoint or enable CPU off-loading as described in the model card.\n\n", "metadata": {"source": "d:\\vga\\vga_agents\\resource\\flux_tool_guide.md", "title": "flux_tool_guide.md", "chunk_id": 0}, "token": 642}], "title": "flux_tool_guide.md"}
