We will use the `requests` library to accomplish this task.\n```\nimport requests\ndef download_image(url, filename):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        with open(filename, 'wb') as file:\n        file.write(response.content)\n\telse:\n\t\tprint(f\"Error: Failed to download image from {url}\")\n\n# Example usage\nimage_url = \"https://example.com/image.jpg\" # Replace with the URL of the image you want to download\nfilename = \"downloaded_image.jpg\"\ndownload_image(image_url, filename)\n```\n## Step 2: Opening and Displaying the Image\nNext, we will use the `Pillow` library to open and display the image we just downloaded.\n```\nfrom PIL import Image\ndef open_and_show_image(filename):\nimage = Image.open(filename)\nimage.show()\n# Example usage\nopen_and_show_image(filename)\n```\n\n\nBy now, you have learned how to download images using Python and perform basic image\noperations using the Pillow library. You can extend these basics to implement more complex image\nprocessing functions as needed.\n", "metadata": {"source": "d:\\vga\\vga_agents\\resource\\proceed_img_guide.md", "title": "proceed_img_guide.md", "chunk_id": 0}, "token": 333}], "title": "proceed_img_guide.md"}
